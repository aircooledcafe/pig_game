Pig Game - A Javascript Project

A basic two player game in which each player takes it in turns to roll a dice.
The player can choose to keep rolling or hold to keep their current total roll, to add it to their accumulated total.
If the player rolls a one they loose the current points nad the other player begins their turn.

The game was made as part of a course I did from Udemy:
